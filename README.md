## üìå Overview

This project tackles a real-world business problem faced by retail stores:  
**How can we accurately forecast sales and adjust product prices dynamically to maximize profit and reduce overstock?**

Using time series forecasting models and simulated pricing logic, I‚Äôve created a complete pipeline from raw sales data to actionable pricing insights.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset

- **Source**: [Sales Forecasting Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/c/robikscube/sales-forecasting)
- **Description**: Daily item-level sales data for 10 stores over 5 years (~900,000 rows)

### üìÅ Columns:
- `date` ‚Äì Date of sale  
- `store` ‚Äì Store ID  
- `item` ‚Äì Item ID  
- `sales` ‚Äì Number of items sold

## üß† Problem Statement

A retail chain wants to:
1. **Predict future sales** of each product in each store
2. **Adjust product prices dynamically** based on forecasted demand
3. **Maximize revenue** and **reduce losses from overstocking**

## üîÑ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** ‚Äì Checked nulls, formatted dates, removed outliers
2. **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Extracted month, weekday, holidays
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì Identified trends & seasonality
4. **Time Series Modeling** ‚Äì Used Prophet & ARIMA for forecasting
5. **Dynamic Pricing Logic** ‚Äì Simulated price changes based on demand
6. **Insights & Recommendations** ‚Äì What to promote, when to discount
7. *(Optional)*: Interactive dashboard using Power BI
